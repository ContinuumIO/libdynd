Developer Documentation Index
=============================

This is the documentation for developers of the DyND library. It's the home of design documents, information for developers interested in joining the DyND development team, and documentation focused on how to modify DyND as opposed to use it as a library.

See [The DyND Library Documentation](../docs/index.md) if you want to use DyND as a library or to better understand it before delving into the details here.
