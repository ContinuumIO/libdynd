Documentation Index
===================

This is the documentation for the DyND library. It's being updated
piecemeal, in concert with active DyND development, so may
be out of date in places. Please email <izaid@continuum.io>
for any queries regarding the library.

This documentation is focused on usage of DyND, for documentation on DyND's internals, see [The DyND Developer Documentation](../devdocs/index.md).
